						South Asia. It is a government-owned self-financed
						institute that operates under the purview of the
						Ministry of Education. As a leading educational centre

						Plymouth, UK, and Victoria University, Australia.
						Focused on producing competent professionals and
						innovative entrepreneurs for the increasingly
						globalising world, NSBM nurtures its graduates to become
						productive citizens of society with their specialisation

						best-performing graduate school and being recognised
						internationally, NSBM currently achieves approximately
						3000 new enrollments per year and houses above 11,000
						students reading over 50 degree programmes under 4
						faculties. Moreover, over the years, NSBM Green
						University has gifted the nation with 14,000+ graduates

						network spread all across the world. Nestling on a
						40-acre land amidst the greenery and serenity in
						Pitipana, Homagama, NSBM Green University, is an
						ultra-modern university complex constructed with
						state-of-the-art facilities and amenities that provides
